# Boolean_Query_and_Inverted_Index
 To implement two strategies to return boolean query results: term-at-a-time and document-at-a-time.

 Step 1: Interact with Lucene Index using the Lucene API and Build Your Own Inverted Index
 Step 2: Boolean Query Processing - Write functions to return the postings list for search terms, return results for boolean AND/OR queries for input terms. Use two different strategies Term-At-A-Time and Document-At-A-Time strategies and compare the no. of comparisons required for the same query using the two strategies.
